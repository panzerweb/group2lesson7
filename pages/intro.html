                                    Filipino women have joined the labor force due to economic necessity and opportunities.
                                    Despite growth in numbers and participation, women still face challenges in achieving employment parity with men.

                                    Labor force participation remains lower than men's rates. Family responsibilities often constrain employment opportunities.

                                According to <strong class="fw-bold">National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)</strong>, the goal of the government is to increase women participation in the labor force by creating more opportunities available.

                                Moreover, the Government's target under Philippine Development Plan or PDP from 2023 to 2028 is for female force participation rate to rise in between 52 and 54 percent in 2028.

As those under the factors are <strong>40%</strong> less likely to participate in the labor market than those single status individuals.

This situation is not only detrimental to the development of our values as a society, but also to the growth of our economy. Regardless of gender, lower labor force participation translates to lower productivity and slower GDP (gross domestic product) growth,”.</p>
