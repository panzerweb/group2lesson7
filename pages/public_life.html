                                Until the mid-1930s, only men in the Philippines had the right to vote. The 1935 Constitution initially restricted suffrage to male citizens aged 21 and above. However, it included a provision allowing women to vote if at least 300,000 qualified women approved it in a plebiscite.

                                            This led to <strong>Commonwealth Act No. 34</strong>, which facilitated a
                                            plebiscite on <strong>April 30, 1937</strong>. Nearly 500,000 women voted in
                                            favor, granting Filipino women the right to vote and run for office. Since
                                            then, women have played an active role in Philippine politics, including the
                                            election of two female presidents: <strong>Corazon Aquino (1986-1992) and
                                                Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2001-2010).</strong>

                                            The <strong>1973 and 1987 Constitutions</strong> further expanded voting
                                            rights by lowering the voting age from 21 to <strong>18 years old</strong>.
                                            Today, Filipino women hold key positions across the government, including in
                                            the <strong>Senate, House of Representatives, Judiciary, and national
                                                commissions</strong>.

                                            Cory Aquino’s presidency was more than a political shift—it was a defining
                                            moment for women empowerment in politics. Breaking barriers in a
                                            male-dominated arena, she led the nation with <strong>strength, integrity,
                                                and compassion</strong>, proving that women could hold the highest
                                            office in the land.

                                            Her leadership saw the creation of the <strong>1987 Constitution</strong>,
                                            reinforcing democracy and securing civil liberties, including greater
                                            political participation for women. This paved the way for more women in
                                            government, highlighting their vital role in shaping the nation’s future.

                                            <strong>However</strong>, this also poses several challenges to the women in
                                            political environment such as <strong>limited family and societal
                                                support</strong>, that leads to <strong>fewer women than men run for
                                                public office</strong>, as well a woman running for politics are
                                            <strong>less encouraged unlike their male counterparts.</strong>

                                            Today, Aquino’s legacy stands as a testament to the power of women in

                                Philippines' public sector. Over the years, the number of elected women has consistently
                                grown, except for a slight <strong>2.6% decline in 2004</strong>, as reported by the
                                Commission on Elections (Comelec). By <strong>2016</strong>, women held <strong>21.5% of
                                    all elected positions</strong>—the highest percentage recorded in the past seven
                                election cycles.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Additionally, the <strong>2016 elections</strong> saw the highest proportion
                                of female candidates at <strong>19.4%</strong>, demonstrating a growing willingness
                                among women to run for public office. This figure includes candidates across <em>all
                                    elective roles</em> in the <strong>executive and legislative branches</strong>, as

                                        Unlike men, women are often <strong style="color: red;">discouraged</strong>

                                        to enter politics often do not receive the same level of encouragement as men
                                        from their families, political parties, and society. Politics has long been a
                                        male-dominated field, and women frequently face skepticism about their ability
                                        to lead, making it harder for them to secure nominations or financial backing

                                        subjected to sexist attacks, making it even more difficult for them to establish
                                        credibility and maintain public support.

                                        Traditional gender roles place a heavier burden of domestic responsibilities on
                                        women, making it challenging for them to balance political careers with societal
                                        expectations of being primary caregivers. Many women are discouraged from
                                        pursuing leadership positions because their political ambitions are seen as
                                        secondary to their family duties.






                                        While women's
                                        growing presence in politics is expected to bring positive changes—such as
                                        reducing corruption and prioritizing social issues—their low representation
                                        highlights the ongoing challenges they face in achieving equal political
                                        participation.

                            Women’s participation in politics is essential for <strong>balanced representation,</strong>
                            inclusive policymaking, and addressing real social issues.

                            <h4> 1. More Diverse Perspectives in Decision-Making</h4>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Politics has long been male-dominated, meaning policies and laws are often shaped by male
                            experiences and priorities. When women are in leadership roles, they bring different
                            perspectives, particularly on healthcare, education, labor rights, and family welfare—issues
                            that directly affect households and communities.
                            <br>
                            For example, in the Philippines, female lawmakers have been at the forefront of legislation
                            on domestic violence (RA 9262), reproductive health (RH Law), and maternal care. These are
                            issues that might not have received the same attention if women were not in positions of
                            power.

                            <br>
                            <h4>2. A More Inclusive and Representative Government</h4>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Women make up about half of the population, yet they remain underrepresented in political
                            offices. If democracy is supposed to represent the people, then excluding women—or keeping
                            their numbers low—means decisions are made without fully considering half the population’s
                            needs and perspectives.

                            <h4>3. Encouraging More Women to Enter Politics</h4>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One of the biggest challenges is that women who aspire to enter politics receive less
                            support than men—from their families, political parties, and society. Many women fear
                            backlash or feel they have to prove themselves twice as much to be taken seriously.

                            Having more women in politics helps normalize female leadership, making it easier for future
                            generations of women to enter the political sphere without facing the same level of
                            skepticism and resistance.

                                    Since independence, the Philippines has always had at least one female legislator,
                                    and women have slowly gained more positions in local and national government.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, political dynasties still dominate, meaning that many women in politics
                                    come from powerful families rather than grassroots movements.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Women who enter politics still face gendered attacks, where they are criticized more
                                    for their appearance, personal lives, or emotional reactions than their actual
                                    policies.
                                </p>
                                <br><br>
                                <h3>Conclusion: Women in Politics Make a Practical Difference</h3>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    Women’s political participation isn’t just about equality for equality’s sake—it
                                    leads to more inclusive policies, broader representation, and a shift in political
                                    priorities. However, expecting women to be miracle workers who “fix corruption” or
                                    “govern better than men” is unrealistic. Instead, the goal should be to create a
                                    political system where both men and women contribute equally, ensuring that
                                    leadership reflects the needs and experiences of all citizens.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>

                                    <strong>🚀 Bottom line: Women in politics won’t magically fix governance, but
                                        excluding them
                                        ensures that policymaking remains one-sided. Representation matters—not as an
                                        ideal,
                                        but as a necessity for a functioning democracy.</strong>
